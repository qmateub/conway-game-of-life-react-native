This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## What this is?
A result of a lonely weekend ðŸ˜…. I've just started a simply and basic version of the
Conway's Game of Life with 2 buttons, one to "evolve" to the next Generation and another one
to reset to the first generation.

As I said, this is just a first/basic/poor version of the GoL, I will keep updating this
whenever I have time.


## How to start it?
Just clone the repo, change to the repo directory and run `yan start`.
The QR code should be scanned by the expo App.


## To-Do List

1. Improve code, namings, and performances.
2. Use auto animation to perform every generation
3. Configuration screen for rows/columns, size of cells, max starting cells, etc.
4. Add tests
